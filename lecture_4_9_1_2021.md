# Proteins

- western blotting
- cell compartments

### major chemicals in a cell

- water
- lipids (membranes)
- macromolecules
	- proteins
		- amino acid subunit
	- nucleic acids
		- nucleotide subunit
	- carbohydrates
		- sugar subunit

### water is special
- polar
- tetrahedral h-bond arrangement

### phospholipids
- hydrophilic head (phosphate), hydrophobic tail (lipid)
- membrane bilayer made of these

### carbohydrates
- energy storage
- structural
- signalling

### nucleic acids (DNA and RNA)
- DNA stores genetici nformation
- RNA facilitates its transfer (transcription, translation)

### proteins
- shape (conformation) determines function
- structure = function

### amino acids
- 20 different natural amino acids
- amino group and carboxyl group
- side chain (R group) is what determines properties
- biological form is generally ionized form when they're on their own.
- amino acids can be polar and nonpolar
- amino acids can be negative or positive as well
- carboxyl group of one amino group binds to amino group of the next, so each protein has an N-terminus and a C-terminus

- 4 categories of structure
	- primary structure; the sequence of amino acids
	- secondary structure; the immediate kind of folding (alpha helices, beta sheets)
	- tertiary structure; more complex folding of the protein
	- quaternary structure; how proteins agglomerate with other proteins
		- not all proteins have quaternary structure

- where proteins localize in the cell says something about what they do

### cellular fractionation

- busting up those cells
- pulling parts out based on density

steps:
- get some cells (suspension or tissue)
- break them up (high frequency, detergent, force through a hole, mortar and pestle)
	- results in free organelles
- spin down in a centrifuge, which separates by density
	- results in a pellet at the bottom, and a supernatant fluid
- speed determines what you get (differential centrifugation)
	- low speed, homogenous solution
	- medium, nuclei
	- high, mitochondria
	- very high, ER and vesicles
	- what remains is ribosomes and viruses
	- no such thing as a pure fraction

- take each pellet and denature the proteins
	- apply detergent, linearizes the proteins
	- ready for electrophoresis

### electrophoresis
- apply a voltage to a gel
- load proteins into well
- voltage pulls proteins through gel
- proteins are deposited in gel preferentially based on their molecular weight
- stain gel, shows where the protein is.

### western blot
- analogous to immunofluorescence
- transfer proteins in gel onto membrane
- apply primary antibody which binds uniquely to protein of interest
- apply secondary antibody which fluoresces and attaches to primary antibody

- use each lane of gel for a different fraction
- error emerges from impurity of the fractions and from imperfect specificity of antibodies

### pull-downs

- a kind of affinity column chromatography
- solid matrix which contains one protein of interest
- column is filled with solvent
- proteins still in folded state
- elute the fractions

- immunoaffinity column chromatography
- beads coated with antibodies that bind protein of interest
- molecules other than protein of interest pass through
- later elute the column for a sample of protein of interest and interacting proteins

### protein functions
- enzymes
- pumps/channels/transporters
- motors
- signals

### protein structure determines function
- proteins bind to molecules (ligands)
- these are generally weak bonds (like h bonds, not covalent)
- binding strength is a function of both compatibility of shape and compatibility of noncovalent interactions

### alpha helices
- hydrophobic helices can pass through membranes
	- transmembrane domain

### beta sheets
- r groups face in opposite directions

### a helices and b sheets together make tertiary structure
- domains are units of tertiary structure
- proteins can have multiple structural domains

### quaternary structure only applies to multimeric protein complexes
- in immunoaffinity experiment, A and its friends formed a quaternary structure

### how do proteins fold?
- small proteins can do so spontaneously (like a drop of oil in water beading up)
- proteins in the cytosol; hydrophobic bits faces inward

### most interactions are non-covalent
- ionic bond
- hydrogen bond
- van der waals

### some covalent interactions
- cysteine-cysteine bonds, aka disulfide bonds
- cysteine r-group is (CH2)(SH)
- very stable structure
- with a harsh detergent, most bond will unfold except for disulfide bonds
- reducing agent can cleave the bonds (beta mercaptoethanol)
