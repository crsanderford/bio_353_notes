# evolution of endosymbiotic organelles

- single original mitochondrial ancestor

- plasma membrane of any given mitochondrion is contiguous with original ancestor

### evolution through endosymbiosis
- infoldings in plasma membrane of prokaryote create endomembrane components
- consumption of aerobic bacteria results in mitochondria
- consumption of photosynthetic bacteria results in chloroplasts

- many endosymbiotic events occur, but rarely result in organelles
	- amoeba that swallow algae without digesting it

### chloroplasts/mitochondria evolved from bacteria
- evidence from structure
- bacterial outer and inner membrane
- presence of MICOS

### mitochondrial genomes
- some mitochondrial genomes only encode 3 genes
	- some as many as 70
- why is there a difference?
- circular, bacteria-like genomes
- encode components for bacteria-like ribosomes, ETC components

### why have separate mitochondrial/chloroplast genomes?
- CoRR(co-localization for redox regulation)
	- ETC and ATP synthase genes must be transcribed and translated near where they function as proteins

- hydrophobicity hypothesis
	- certain genes can't be moved to the nucleus because protein products are too hydrophobic to move to the mitochondria

### beta barrels
- pretty much only chloroplasts/mitochondria/bacteria contain beta barrels in outer membranes
- only 4 known eukaryotic beta barrels, humans only have 3 of them
- SAM complex assembles beta-barrels into MOM, has homologue in bacteria

### ER contact sites
- no vesicular transport at ER-mitochondrial contact sites

### phylogenetics
- mitochondria always show up close to alphaproteobacteria
- chloroplasts always show up close to cyanobacteria

### mitochondrial division
- Min/FtsZ system for division in ancestral mitochondria, like bacteria
- many eukaryotic lineages no longer have this, replaced with dynamin

### mitochondria and chloroplast reduction
- mitochondria related organelles
	- hydrogenosomes and mitosomes

- non-synthetic plastids in parasitic plants/algae
	- malaria

### complete loss of mitochondria/chloroplasts?
-  only one known genus has completely lost mitochondria
	-  monocercomonoides

- many mitochondria have lost their genomes, but they're anaerobic
- many photosynthetic lineages have lost photosynthesis
- only parasites have completely lost the plastid itself
- once you get an endosymbiote, it's hard to get rid of it

### diversity of mitochondria related organelles (MROs)
- anaerobic mitochondrion; generates ATP but has an electron acceptor other than oxygen (fumarate)
- hydrogenosomes; no oxidative phosphorylation, ATP made by substrate-level phosphorylation, produce hydrogen
- mitosome; most reduced MRO, no ATP generation, participate in Fe-S cluster biosynthesis, localization of the ISC pathway
	- iron-sulfur clusters are cofactors in many enzymes

### secondary endosymbionts derive from eukaryotes
- cyanobacterium consumed by heterotrophic eukaryote
	- produces photosynthetic eukaryotes
	- red algae and green algae

- red algae and green algae consumed by heterotrophic eukaryotes
- green algae - euglenids, chlorarachniophytes
- red algae - dinoflagellates, apicomplexans, stramenopiles

- secondary endosymbionts often lose a membrane (phagocytic membrane)

### why is nucleomorph retained?
- doesn't have to be
- mostly an evolutionary accident, froze in transition states

### secondary plasmid protein import
