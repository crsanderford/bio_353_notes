# cell signaling

### cell signaling/signal transduction
- transmission of information from outside the cell to inside the cell
- transmission of information within the cell
- begins when a receptor protein on the outside of the cell receives a signal (binds a ligand)
- converts ligand-binding signal to an intracellular signal
- signal transduction pathways are very complex

### extracellular signaling molecules
- proteins/peptides
- amino acids
- nucleotides
- steroid hormones
- fatty acid derivatives
- Gases (ethylene, NO)
- and others

### signaling happens over varied ranges
- endocrine: whole body, through bloodstream, via hormones
- paracrine: local signaling through cell releasing a ligand to it's neighbors
- neuronal: neurotransmitters, over synapses
- contact-dependent: one cell produces a membrane-bound signal molecule, which cells in contact can bind

### responses to signals can be fast or slow
- changes in protein structure/function can happen very fast (seconds to minutes)
- changes in gene expression and protein synthesis can be slow (minutes to hours)

### two classes of receptors
- cell-surface receptors lie on the outer plasma membrane of the cell, bind extracellular signal molecules
	- basically always transmembrane proteins
- intracellular receptors are somewhere inside the cell, bind signal molecules that can pass through the outer membrane (steroid hormones, gases)

### nitric oxide (NO)
- regulates blood pressure
- nerve cells release acetylcholine to endothelial cells, acetylcholine binds to NO synthase (cell surface receptor)
- NO synthase makes NO from arginine, which diffuses across the cell membrane
- NO reaches smooth muscle cells, diffuses through membrane, binds to guanyl cyclase (an intracellular receptor)
- guanyl cyclase takes GTP, makes cyclic GMP, which causes smooth muscle cell relaxes

### most extracellular signal molecules bind to cell-surface receptors

### receptor proteins activate complex intracellular signalling pathways

- extracellular signaling molecule > receptor protein > intracellular signaling molecules > effector proteins > cell responses
- effector proteins; proteins that *do something* (alter metabolism, raise ATP production, cytoskeletal proteins)

### general principles

- relay: one intracellular signal molecule activates/generates the next.
- amplification: a small number of extracellular signal molecules can produce a large number of intracellular messenger molecules (oftentimes this happens with enzymes - which can kind of act like transistors)
- feedback: changes in signals can be sensed and controlled using feedback.
- integration: intracellular signaling protein can receive signals from more than one pathway, and combine the signals together
- distribution: the signalling cascade can take one signal and use it to influence multiple processes

### three major types of cell surface receptors

- ion channel-coupled receptors
	- ion channel opens when correct signal molecule has bound
	- not active transport
	- in animal cells, sodium, potassium, and calcium
	- converts a chemical signal into an electrical signal
	- other ion channels (voltage-gated ones) can then respond to the voltage by opening, amplifying and propagating the signal
- G-protein coupled receptors
	- humans have about 700 GPCRs
	- multi-pass transmembrane proteins, similar structure
	- binds to a ligand on the extracellular side, causing a conformational change that lets it bind to a G protein on the intracellular side
	- G protein is off when bound to GDP
	- when bound to GPCR, undergoes conformational change to drop GDP and bind GTP
	- alpha subunit and beta-gamma subunits can release one another and activate other things
	- later on, intrinsic GTPase activity hydrolyzes the GTP, returns to inactive form and binds back together
	- some G proteins activate enzymes to make second messengers (like cAMP, cGMP)
- enzyme-coupled receptors
	- transmembrane receptor is itself an enzyme
	- extracellular side is a receptor
	- intracellular side is an enzyme, or binds to something else to create an enzyme (when the extracellular side is activated)
	- largest class is receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
	- RTKs come in pairs
	- signal molecule is a dimer
	- when two RTKs bind the dimer, they both phosphorylate one another
	- then can activate other proteins
	- one pair of activated RTKs can activate a bunch of other proteins, forming a complex
	- most RTKs activate Ras (the GTPase)
		- 30 percent of human tumors have active mutant forms of Ras

### molecular switches
- protein phosphorylation
	- protein kinase phosphorylates a protein, turning it on
	- protein phosphatase dephosphorylates a protein, turning it off
- GTP-binding proteins
	- swapping GDP for GTP turns the protein on (done by GEF, guanosine exchange factor)
	- hydrolyzing GTP to GDP turns it off (done by GAP, guanosine activating protein, or by the protein doing it itself)
