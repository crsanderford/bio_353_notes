prokaryotes
- bacteria and archaea
	- pill shaped or spherical
	- no obvious internal structures/organelles

eukaryotes evovled from asgard archaea

mitochondria/chloroplasts evolved from bacteria

eukaryotes have large and obvious organelles
 - which leeuwenhoek could see

eukaryotes come in lots of different shapes

transmitted light microscopy
- similar to early microscopes
	- but with way more lenses
- shine light through a sample, collect it, project it

problem: cells are mostly transparent

solution: stain cells with dyes that are preferential to parts of the cell
- H and E; hematoxylin and eosin
	- hematoxylin is positively charged, so it binds to negatively charged cell components (DNA)

solution: optics that generate contrast where there's a difference in density or refractive index in the cell
- can image live cells

nucleus contains the nucleolus
nucleus contains genetic material (DNA)
nucleus is surrounded by two bilayer membranes

endoplasmic reticulum is contiguous with the nuclear membrane

nuclear pore complex regulates movement of macromolecules into and out of the nucleus

### membranes

- maintain barrier between inside and outside of cells
	- maintains barrier between organelles

bilayer formed by hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity

membrane proteins embedded in membrane, can be on either or both sides

5 nm thin

### electron microscopy
why electrons
- greater mass means shorter wavelength, higher magnification, higher resolution
- magnets bend electrons, act as lenses
- can image the two bilayers of the nucleus
- intermembrane space - perinuclear space - lumen

### endoplasmic reticulum
 - tubular membranes, flattened sacs
 - inside - lumen
 - rough ER has ribosomes on the outer surface, looks rough under TEM
	 - synthesizes proteins that exit the cell (secretion, membrane proteins)
- smooth ER, highly undulating appearance
	- no role in protein synthesis
	- no ribosomes
	- synthesis of lipids, sterols, steroid hormones
	- detoxification of drugs and toxins
	- specialized subdomains of sER store calcium ions
		- sarcoplasmic reticulum

### golgi complex
- bundle of membrane enclosed sacks in animal cells
- many organisms don't have stacked Golgi, and instead parts of the golgi are all around the cell
- involved in chemical modification (attaching sugars to proteins), sorting, packaging proteins received from rough ER
- sort proteins to other vesicular compartments

### peroxisomes
- handle hydrogen peroxides, reactive oxygen compounds
- tied functionally/evolutionarily to mitochondria
- organisms that lose mitochondria lose peroxisomes
- single-membrane bound
- grainy appearance compared to cytoplasm
- peroxisomes often have a chunk on the inside that is denser. we don't know what it is.

### vesicles
- small, enclosed organelles, with stuff inside the lumen
- travel from one organelle to another
- if a protein needs to go from rough ER to golgi, it's transported by a vesicle

### cytoskeleton
- protein filaments that undergo reorganization
- 3 filaments - actin, microtubules, intermediate filaments
- contributes to cell motility, intracellular motility, organization, cell shape, rigidity

### flagella and cilia
- flagella are long and there are only few of them
- ciliar are short and common
- bacterial flagella evolutionarily unrelated to flagella
- cells generally pull themselves using flagella

- eukaryotic flagellum has a membrane all the way around it
- prokaryotic flagellum has no membrane

- 9 + 2 structure - nine doublets of microtubules around in a circle, 2 on the inside

### mitochondria
- the powerhouse of the cell

- all eukaryotic cells contain mitochondria, or some reduced form
	- except one species and some specialized cells (red blood cells)
- atp production, fatty acid oxidation
- often branched or reticular
- double-membrane bound (evolved from gram negative bacteria)

- cristae - invaginations of the inner membrane
	- proton gradient across cristae MIM
	- ATP synthase across the crisate MIM
	- cristae are like plates
- have their own genome
	- encode bacteria-like ribosomes
	- bacteria like ATP synthase, and electron transport chain proteins
- they move, fuse and divide!

### fluorescence microscopy

- allows detection of specific proteins or molecules that are labeled with fluorescent molecules
- fluorescence - absorbs light at one wavelength, emits at a different wavelength
- dichroic mirror (two color mirror)
	- reflects one wavelength, transmits the other

### chloroplasts

- photosynthesis
- double-membrane organelles
- derived from an endosymbiont
	- cyanobacteria
- thylakoid - invaginations of inner membrane
- proton gradient across thylakoid membrane
- atp synthase in thylakoid membrane
- have their own genome
	- bacteria like ribosomes and proteins
- move, fuse and divide
