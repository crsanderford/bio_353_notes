# protein and membrane traficking

### compartmentalization of cells

- transport in and out of the nucleus already discussed
- other cell compartments/organelles?

- for mitochondria/chloroplasts, proteins transported directly into organelles
- for ER/golgi/endosomes, transported via vesicles

### three mechanisms of protein transport
- Ran/importin mediated
- translocation across membranes (this lecture)
- vesicular trafficking (occurs after sorting to ER)(this and other lectures)

### different signal sequences direct proteins to different compartments

- often not the precise sequence of the signal that matters, but rather the biochemical/biophysical/structural properties of the signal that matters
	- mitochondria signal sequences are often spiral-ish

### ribosome location matters for protein location
- free ribosomes translate proteins that end up in the cytosol, mitochondria, nuclear proteins
- rough ER ribosomes translate proteins that end up in endomembrane compartments

### signal recognition particle

- SRP binds to a signal peptide that is on the translating protein
- SRP binds to SRP receptor on the rough ER, docking the ribosome
- Passes the translating protein into the lumen of the ER
- similar things happen with soluble ER proteins and transmembrane ER proteins

### mitochondria have four compartments

- mitochondrial inner membrane, mitochondrial outer membrane, intermembrane space, matrix
- mitochondrial matrix-targeted proteins are amphiphatic alpha helices (negative on one side, hydrophobic on the other)
- import into the mitochondrial inner membrane requires passing through two protein translocators, signal cleaved inside the MIM.
- normally 99 percent of the imported protein is in the mature form.

## membrane trafficking

- endocytosis - membrane transport into the cell (endocytic pathway)
- endocytosis - membrane transport out of the cell (secretory pathway)

### some proteins stay in the ER
- KDEL signal keeps protein in the ER
	- lys-asp-glu-leu at C-terminus
	- bound by KDEL receptors
- vesicles bud from the donor compartment and fuse with the target compartment
	- soluble proteins *inside* the vesicle and membrane proteins *on* the vesicle are transferred from the donor to the target
- membrane orientation is retained - the cytosolic face of the membrane always faces the cytosol
- vesicles from ER arrive at cis-Golgi.
	- ER -> ERGIC -> cis-Golgi -> medial-Golgi -> trans-Golgi -> trans-Golgi network
	- each compartment is biochemically distinct
	- paper is about how golgi compartments become biochemically distinct
		- Cisternal maturation model?
		- or Stable compartments model?
		- cisternal maturation model the *compartments themselves transform over time* and move from cis to trans
		- stable compartments model - the cisternae stay the same over time, and proteins move *through* them

### oligosaccharides in the golgi
- the golgi mostly adds oligosaccharides to proteins

### two kinds of exocytosis
- regulated exocytosis
	- induced by a signal
- constitutive exocytosis
	- happens continuously independent of a signal (replenshment of membrane)

### two kinds of endocytosis
- pinocytosis ('cellular drinking') - small endocytosis
	- replenishment of membrane
- phagocytosis ('cellular eating') - large endocytosis
	- neutrophils eating bacteria

## vesicular transport

- no midterm stuff after this point

### endomembrane system consists of
- ER
	- nuclear envelope
- Golgi
- endosomes
- lysosomes
- peroxisomes(ish)
- sorting compartments
- lots of vesicles

### endomembrane evolution
- endomembrane system likely emerged from invagination of the cell membrane
- direction of lysosome proton pump implies this - it's inside-out compared to mitochondria

### membrane bending/budding/fusion
- bending membrane is energetically unfavorable
- coat proteins bend vesicles
	- clathrin
		- endocytic pathway
	- COPI
		- Intra-golgi, golgi to ER
	- COPII
		- ER to golgi

- pinching off membrane (scission) is very energetically unfavorable
	- scission is perfomed by dynamin, forms a ring around the tube

- after budding, clathrin is released
