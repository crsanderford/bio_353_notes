# vesicle transport

### vesicular transport responsible for transport in the endomembrane system

- nuclear envelope
- ER
- golgi
- endosome
- lysosome
- plasma membrane

### vesicle transport is energetically unfavorable

- requires an energy input
- driven by coat proteins
	- clathrin, COP1, COP2

- COP2 drives ER to golgi
- COP1 drives anterograde golgi traffic, golgi to ER traffic
- clathrin drives trans-golgi to plasma membrane, other organelles

- clathrin subunits have potential energy, forming a basket structure is favorable.

- pinching off final "neck" of vesicle is very unfavorable
	- this is done by dynamin
	- dynamin multimerizes around the neck, then hydrolyzes GTP to squeeze and twist

- after budding, clathrin coat must disassemble
	- clathrin basket was energetically favorable - clathrin has the energy to form vesicles because unbound clathrin is unstable.

- Hsc70 proteins are ATPases that provide clathrin with the energy to disassemble.

### how are cargo proteins sorted into vesicles?
- cargo receptors bind cargo proteins, concentrate them into vesicles.
- cargo receptors bind adaptor proteins which recruit clathrin


lumen of most endomembrane organelles is somewhat acidic

### how are vesicles targeted to destinations?

three classes of proteins involved in targeting.

Rab GTPases:
- GTPase protein, like Ran and Ras
- in active GTP form, bind the vesicle membrane and recruit other ptoeins
	- often recruits motor proteins

Tethering proteins:
- variety of kinds
- often interact with Rab
- attached to target membrane
- hold vesicles near the target membrane

SNARE proteins
- t-SNAREs and v-SNAREs
- t on target, v on vesicle
- SNAREs interact to fuse vesicle with membrane

soap bubbles can spontaneously fuse, lipid membranes do not
- air is very light, low interactions. they get out of the way
- water molecules are heavier, have more interactions, get in the way

SNARE proteins drive vesicle fusion
- snare proteins contain potential energy
- use this energy to coil together, squeezing water out of the way
- once membranes are close enough they fuse.
- SNARE proteins must release one another to be used again, which requires energy
- ATPase called NSF provides energy for disassembly, restores potential energy to SNAREs
