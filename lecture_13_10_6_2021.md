# endosymbiotic organelles

- nucleomorph; what remains of the nucleus in a chloroplast

### mitochondria and chloroplasts evolved from endosymbionts

- mitochondria from alphaproteobacteria
- chloroplasts from cyanobacteria

- plastids are any cyanobactera derived organelle

- not within the endomembrane system

### mitochondria and chloroplasts are energy organelles

- mitochondria - cell respiration
	- sugar + o2 -> co2, h2o, atp
- chloroplasts - photosynthesis
	- h20 + light -> atp
	- atp + co2 -> carbs

### mitochondrial structure
- mom, mitochondrial outer membrane, "bacterial outer membrane"
- mim, mitochondrial inner membrane, bacterial inner membrane
- ims - bacterial periplasmic space
- matrix - bacterial cytoplasm
- cristae are invaginations of the mim

### chloroplast structure
- com, bacterial outer membrane
- cim, bacterial inner membrane
- ims, bacterial periplasmic space
- stroma, bacterial cytoplasm
- thylakoid are invagination of CIM that pinch off

### similarities
- mom = com
- mim - cim
- ims = ims
- matrix = stroma
- thylakoid and cristae are similar but not homologous

### mito, chloro make atp with proton gradients
- both use electron transport chains
- energy from food, energy from sunlight
- both drive proton gradients

### glycolysis and krebs
- glycolysis happens in the cytosol
- krebs cycle happens in the mitochondria

### atp synthesis in the cristae membranes

### mitochondria make a proton gradient usnig products from the krebs cycle

- electrons donate to ETC by high-energy carriers
- ETC pumps protons
- ATP synthase uses the proton gradient to make ATP

### cristae are the sites of electron transport, proton pumping, atp synthesis
- localized to cristae membranes
- cristae membranes are compositionally distinct from remaining MIM

- ATP synthases is rotated by proton flow, which forces conformational changes in lower subunit, which forces phosphate to bind to ADP

- in eukaryotes, ATP synthase is a dimer
	- dimer forces the creation of crisate by bending the membrane

### ETC supercomplexes
- etc components interact
- cristae membranes are 75% by weight protein, only 25% by weight lipid

### different atp synthases bend membranes differently
- flat cristae in animals, fungi, plants
- tubular cristae in many protists
