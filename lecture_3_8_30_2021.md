# The Nucleus

- the nucleus (and ER) may have evolved from invagination of the plasma membrane in ancestral archaea.
	- outer membrane invaginates, breaks off, surrounds internal DNA
	- genome enclosed inside nucleus provides physical protection, viral protection, and more complex genetic regulation through compartmentalization
	- dolly the sheep - you can suck a nucleus out of a cell and deposit it into another
	- mammalian viruses must penetrate the nuclear barrier

- nuclear envelope is contiguous with the ER
	- proteins and lipids synthesized in the ER have direct access to the nuclear envelope

- nuclear lamina
	- mesh of cytoskeleton (intermediate filaments) that line the inside of the nucleus
	- makes the nucleus physically tough

- the nucleus stores most of the cell's DNA (not mitochondria, chloroplasts)
	- transcription and translation
	- DNA is the template for transcription
	- RNA has many functions

### Nucleotides
- carry energy in their easily-hydrolyzed phosphoanhydreide bonds
	- ATP! (or GTP)
- Coenzymes (coenzyme A, CoA)
- signalling molecules (cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cAMP)

### RNA facilitates translation of proteins
- rRNA, ribosomal RNA, the RNA component of ribosomes
	- large subunit and small subunit
- mRNA, messenger RNA, template for protein
- tRNA, transfer RNA, carries the corresponding amino acid

### DNA in the nucleus
- double-helix bound together by hydrogen bonds between basepairs.
- DNA packed into fibers of chromatin
	- wrapped around histones
	- histones are octomers made of 4 different proteins
	- "beads on a string"
- another histone protein holds adjacent beads together, making DNA more dense.

- if you lyse a nucleus, a web of chromatin fibers spills out
- DNA is even more closely packed during cell division

- interphase chromatin contains both heterochromatin (more condensed) and euchromatin (less condensed)
	- chromatin remodeling enzymes reposition histones

- histones proteins have tails that can be post-translationally modified
	- added and removed by histone-modifying enzymes
	- recognized by chromatin-remodeling enzymes

- less condensed regions (euchromatin) are more accessible to transcription
	- chromatin structure regulates gene expression

- humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes
	- of which each chromosome is a single, long molecule of double-stranded DNA
	- chromosomes occupy different areas within the nucleus

### nucleoli
- dark spots on phase contrast, electron microscope
- ribosomal RNA genes are located here, rRNAs are transcribed here
- distributed across multiple chromosomes
	- all the compartmentalization in the nucleus (nucleoli, chromosome territories, chromatin structure) occurs without membrane enclosure
	- happens by liquid-liquid phase separation
	- biophyics mini-lectures


### virus movie
- nucleus is a barrier to viruses
	- viruses may be the main evolutionary pressure
- virus particle can't enter nucleus
- viral dna needs to enter nucleus for transcription (not available in cytoplasm)
- red protein is translated in the cytoplasm, not in the nucleus
- red protein must enter into the nucleus

### nucleus entry/exit
 - nuclear pore complexes
	 - gel-like meshwork of nuclear pore proteins
	 - blocks larger proteins and RNA from diffusing passively through the nuclear envelope

- nuclear import
	- proteins can be actively transported into the nucleus if they have a Nuclear Localization Signal (often a patch of positively charged amino acids)
	- signal is recognized by a Nuclear Import Receptor protein, that passes it through the pores (sometimes called importins)
	- nuclear localization signals can be exposed or inactivated by protein conformation changes, post-translational modificaations, etc
- switch is needed to make import unidirectional
	- protein called RAN is a GTPase
	- hydrolyzes GTP as a molecular switch (and energy source)
	- drives the transport reaction in one direction
	- GTP activating protein (Ran-GAP) causes Ran to hydrolyze phosphate group in the cytoplasm
	- GTP exchange factor (Ran-GEF) causes Ran to drop GDP and pick up GTP

- nuclear export
	- same way but reversed
	- proteins with a nuclear export signal
	- enforced by nuclear export receptors which carry things out of the nucleus
	- coupled to Ran-GTP to transfer out

- complexity comes out of compartmentalization
