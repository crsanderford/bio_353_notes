# mitochondrial metabolism

### positive and negative curvature

- relative to the internal space; not the math definition
- pushing into internal space - negative curvature
- pulling out internal space - positive curvature
- MICOS complex produces positive curvature, atp synthase negative curvature

### different atp synthases bend cristae differently

- animal/plant/fungi ATP synthase have a 90 degree bend, present at tips of cristae (flat)
- protist ATP synthase have a near zero degree bend, coil around cristae (tubular)

### MICOS bends membranes at cristae junctions
- without MICOS, cristae detach from MIM

### MICOS connects MIM to MOM

### mitochondria get most of their proteins from cytosol
- most mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nuclear genome, even though mitochondria have their own genome
	- mitochondrial genome only contains 1% of the genes required to make mitochondria
	- imported and assembled by special translocases

### mitochondrial protein import
- only 3-70 proteins in the mitochondrial genome
- ~1000 mitochondrial proteins encoded in the nucleus
- different targeting signal/mechanism for each mitochondrial compartment

- studied with:
	- mitochondrial fractionation/centrifugation
	- incubation with $S^{35}$ labeled mitochondrial proteins
	- SDS-PAGE, membrane, visualize with detector

### mitochondria fuse and divide regularly
- Fuse to make more ATP
- Escape from autophagy

- divide for reproduction
- prepare for mitophagy
- reduce ATP production

### mitochondrial fusion
- controlled by GTPases related to dynamin
- MFN1, OPA1
	- MFN1 on the outer membrane, fuses outer membrane
	- OPA1 on the inner membrane, fuses inner membrane

### mitochondrial division
- occurs at contact sites between ER and mitochondria
- GTPases dynamin2 and dynamin-related-protein 1 are recruited to surfaces by Fis1, act similar to dynamin. Wrap around and squeeze.

### ER-mitochondrial contact sites
- small mitochondria can undergo mitophagy
- mitophagy uses ER membranes, occurs near ER-mitochondria contact sites
- get encircled in an autophagosome which is moved to a lysosome

### how do mitochondria get their membranes
- occurs at membrane contact sites
- lipid transport proteins move proteins between ER and MOM, MOM and MIM
- mitochondria also make chemical changes to membrane lipids for the rest of the cell

### membrane contact sites occur between other organelles too

### mitochondrial motility
- different cell regions have different energy requirements
- mitochondria must move to be positioned appropriately
- mitochondria must be spaced for cell division

- Miro and Milton (TRAK) connect mitochondria to the microtubule cytoskeleton through a kinesin motor protein
- when Ca2+ is present, Miro interacts with the kinesin preventing mitochondrial motility
