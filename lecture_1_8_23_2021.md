### assessments

- assessments focused on skills
	- formative assessments: building skills
		- iclicker (10%)
		- paper discussions (15%)
		- reading quizzes (5%)
	- summative assessments: benchmarking skills
		- midterm/final
		- must be done independently, alone
		- but takehome, open notes, open internet
		- in some sense cumulative

science and scientific conduct isn't regulated by the law
- falsification/fabrication of data isn't actually illegal
- therefore science requires trust/integrity, self-imposed
- large penalties for misconduct, but extralegal

academic integrity is similar
- only individual students actually know if they acted in good faith
- but there are large extralegal penalties for not complying

academic misconduct devalues the currency of your own education

exams are takehome assignments, not on canvas

### evolutionary history of cells

"how did we get from simple prokaryotes to complex eukaryotes?"

three domains of life:
- eukarya, archaea, bacteria
two grades of life:
- prokaryotes (archaea, bacteria), and eukaryotes

vertical descent with modification; the old view
- archaea are separate from bacteria are separate from eukarya

horizontal gene transfer in prokaryotes, the new view
- massive amounts of horizontal gene transfer between prokaryotes, including between archaea and bacteria
- lots of prokaryotic innovation from horizontal transfer rather than vertical
- diversity of biochemistry rather than morphology

course mainly covers eukaryotes

prokaryotes have a simple architecture, but lots of diverse features
eukaryotes have one single complex structure

gram-positive, one membrane, monoderm
gram negative, two membranes, diderm

alphaproteobacteria -> mitochondria (diderm)
cyanobacteria -> chloroplasts (diderm)

planctomycete bacteria are complex
- can roll around
- can engulf prey
- complex intracellular structure

### archaea

archaea are mostly monoderm
very different from gram-positive bacteria

originally identified as extremophiles, but everywhere

asgard archaea are the closest prokaryotic relatives to eukaryotes

---

### eukaryotes

most eukaryotes are microbial
most not amenable to cell experimentation

animals, plants, fungi are exceptions

kelp isn't a plant (???!?!)

eukaryotes evolved from a heterotropic flagellate


### how did eukaryotes evolve?

evolved from closest archea ancestor (something like asgard)

asgard archaea lack a lot of the intracellular features (nucleus)

alphaproteobacteria entered as an endosymbiont (mitochondria)

evolved *to* a heterotrophic protist

animal, plant, and protist cells are largely made of the same parts

### history of cell biology

anton van leeuwenhoek, father of microscopy

started with glassmaking

use of polished glass as magnifying class
- firestarter
- actual use as magnifying glass
- 3000 years old

eyeglasses developed in the 1200s
- glass grinding to specific shapes, optically clear
- venetian glass was especially optically clear
- dutch lensmakers made good lenses

1600s - the telescope, or spyglass
- patent applications in 1608
- patent office said no - too simple

galileo, telescope, observed the moons of jupiter
- 20x magnification
- threatened heliocentrism

galileo also developed microscopes
- a telescope in reverse

Robert Hooke, *Micrographia*, 1665
- the first pop science book
- looked at fleas, mold on bread
- discovered cells, from looking at cork
- was looking at cell walls

van Leeuwenhoek tried to look at the same thing Hooke did
- venetian glass, stretched into a thin thread, melted into a bead
- described blood cells, sperm cells
- life in drops of pond water
- vorticella
