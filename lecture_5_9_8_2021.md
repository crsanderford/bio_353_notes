# western blots, continued

### how do proteins fold?

- fold spontaneously, based on intramolecular interactions
	- hydrophobic/hydrophilic, covalent interactions, van der waals

### simple proteins can renature after denaturing

- urea is a common and powerful denaturant, disrupts noncovalent bonds

### large proteins require chaperones to properly fold

- chaperone proteins prevent other proteins from aggregating and misfolding into incorrect structures

### protein function
- proteins bind to ligands (could be antigens, or something in a western blot)

### binding sites are made from 3d coordination of amino acids

### proteins act as catalysts (enzymes)

- intracellular transport
- motor proteins walk on microtubules
	- ligands are the cargo and the microtubule itself

### protein function regulation
- post-translational modification - changes protein shape and function
	- phosphorylation - adds a large negative charge
	- ubiquitination - adds signal for degredation to lysines
	- fatty-acid-ation (myristolation, palmitoylation) - adds a hydrophobic tail

### phosphorylation by kinases
- adds a phosphate group to serine, threonine, tyrosine
- dephosphorylation by phosphatase
- phosphorylation is like an on/off switch, but which side is which isn't trivial

### polyubiquitination sends proteins to the proteasome for degredation

### myristoylated GTPases cycle between soluble and membrane-bound

- fatty acid tail lets protein get stuck in membrane

### kinases/phosphatases and GTPases can act like switches

- kinase phosphorylates protein, signal on
- phosphatase dephosphorylates protein, signal off

- GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) swaps GDP to GTP, signal on
- GAP (GTPase activating protein) dephosphorylates GTP, signal off

### membrane proteins
- integral (or transmembrane) proteins, pass through membrane, single pass or multipass
- often alpha-helical, but can be beta-barrels
- can be monolayer-associated or lipid-linked (like myristoylated proteins)

- peripheral membrane proteins, more loosely attached to the proteins

### the cytosolic face of a membrane bilayer is always cytosolic
- and the faces are distinct from one another, different lipid and membrane composition

### membrane protein functions
- transporters/channels
- anchors for other things
- receptors
- enzymes

### transmembrane vs peripheral proteins
- transmembrane goes through the membrane
- peripheral attached to things in/on the membrane
- peripheral proteins are stripped off at high pH
	- no hard and fast rule for what pH will strip peripheral proteins
	- transmembrane proteins stay embedded in membrane sheets
