# membrane permeability and transport

### phase separation between lipids and water is due to water's tendency to self-interact

- water is polar
- water can make four h-bonds with neighboring water molecules in a tetrahedral shape
- this tetrahedral mesh kicks out nonpolar molecules (more favorable for water to bind to itself)
- this is why the lipid bilayer phase separates

### membrane cholesterol varies depending on conditions
- things that live in the cold have more cholesterol in their membranes
	- cholesterol keeps the membrane from solidifying too much

### lipid bilayer is selectively permeable
- small, nonpolar molecules make it through readily (dissolved gasses)
- steroid hormones  are hydrophobic enough to pass through the bilayer
- small polar molecules have a hard time passing through the bilayer (water, ethanol)
- large polar molecules have an even harder time getting through (amino acids, glucose, nucleotides/sides)
- charged molecules essentially cannot pass through

### water is attracted to other polar/charged molecules
- ions are surrounded by a shell of water molecules
- therefore the ions behave as though they were larger molecules
	- and stripping away this shell is energetically unfavorable.

### cells manage osmotic swelling in different ways
- animal cells regulate their ion concentration
- protozoans have a specialized organelle - accumulates extra water, and then fuses with the plasma membrane to discharge water
- plant cells have a rigid cell wall which maintains a contrary force to osmotic pressure.

### intracellular and extracellular ion concentrations are very different
- Na+ lower inside, higher outside
- K+ lower outside, higher inside
- Mg2+ lower inside, higher outside
- Ca2_ lower inside, higher outside

### transmembrane proteins use structure to create passage through membrane
- alpha helices
- beta barrels

### varieties of transport across the membrane
- passive transport; down the gradient
	- simple diffusion; simply passing across the membrane
	- Channel mediated
	- forms a pore or channel through the bilayer
	- can transport ions very fast (1 million ions a second)
		- big and fast responses
	- can be very selective based on size and charge
	- channels are "gated" - can be opened and closed
		- voltage-gated; open or closed depending on membrane potential
		- mechanically-gated; open and close based on mechanical forces on the cell
		- ligand-gated; open and close based on binding a chemical

### patch clamping
- very small glass pipette, filled with salt solution - mimics extracellular environment
- suction onto a cell, tear off membrane patch
- stick into solution that mimics intracellular conditions
- apply voltage, measure current

### transporters
- change their conformational state to bind ligand on one side, and release it on another
- even more selective than ion channels, but slower
- transport bidirectionally - pass material down concentration gradient

### electrochemical gradient
- chemical part of gradient; concentration of any given ion
- electro part of gradient; concentration of any given charge

### active transport
- pushes against concentration gradient
- costs energy

### photosynthesis/oxidative phosphorylation both pump protons

- energy from food pumps protons across membrane in mitochondria
- energy from sunlight pumps protons across membrane in chloroplasts
- ATP synthase is a turbine driven by proton gradients

### in animal cells, a Na+/K+ pump uses ATP to pump out Na+ and K+ in

- step one: Na+ binds to protein
- step two: pump is phosphorylated
- step 3: phosphorylation energy is used to change conformation and release Na+ on other side
- step 4: K+ binds to protein
- step 5: pump dephosphorylates and changes back conformation
- step 6: K+ is released inside cell
- repeat, 3 sodiums out, 2 potassiums in.

### couple the transport of one molecule to another so one gradient can drive another
- one ion falls down it's gradient, the other is pushed up
- the potential of the first molecule drives the potential of the other
- symport: two things in the same direction
- antiport: two things in the opposite direction
- uniport: only one thing

### plant/fungi/bacteria cells pump H+ in place of Na+ and K+
