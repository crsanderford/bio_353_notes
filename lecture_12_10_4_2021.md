# secretory and endocytic pathways

secretory and endocytic pathways are the main ones, but not the only ones

### kdel receptor proteins pull kdel marked proteins back to ER

### chaperone proteins
- recognize and bind misfolded proteins
- bind to unstructured and hydrophobic regions
- help proteins fold right
- restrict improperly folded proteins

### unfolded protein response (UPR)
- triggered by accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins
- triggers expression of transcription factor
- transcription factor increases transcription of chaperone proteins
- chaperone proteins translated into ER, reduces misfolded proteins

### plasma cell, mature B cell
- secretes antibodies
- matures when a specific antigen is detected, makes antibodies in response
- UPR signaling regulates ER size in secretory cells

### UPR degradation
- if proteins stay misfolded, they are degraded
- bound by chaperones, retrotranslocated back to cytoplasm
- tagged by ubiquitin, put into proteasome
- degraded into amino acids

### glycosylation
- addition of a sugar side chain to a protein
- can prevent degradation by proteases
- proper folding - sugars are hydrophilic, can shield hydrophobic regions
- sugars can be charged, present a charged binding site for other proteins
- signal for sorting/transport
- most proteins secreted outside the cell or membrane proteins on the cell are glycosylated

- prefabricated oligosaccharide attached to protein during translation

### ER exit is selective
ER proteins are marked with 3 glucose molecules until folded properly and glycosylated. Only removed afterward.

### golgi modifications
- different organisms glycosylate proteins differently
	- influenza infects birds and mammals, rare that people get bird flu because of birds glycosylate proteins that mediate cell entry

### exocytosis
constitutive exocytosis - secretory vesicles continuously take cargo from golgi to plasma membrane
regulated exocytosis - secretory vesicles accumulate near membrane, fuse in response to cell signaling (release of neurotransmitters)

## endocytic pathway

- take up of fluids, small items
	- pinocytosis (cell drinking)
	- coat proteins bend the membrane (generally clathrin)
	- budding assisted by dynamin

### receptor mediated endocytosis
- LDL receptor
	- binds LDL
	- recruits clathrin to bud vesicle
	- vesicle fuses with early endosome
	- transfer to lysosome for degradation, or:
	- budding off of membrane with receptors for reuse

### early and recycling endosomes
- early endosome located just beneath plasma membrane
- endosome acidity driven by vacuolar atpase
	- causes receptors to release cargo
- ph 6.0

### not all endocytic vesicles use clathrin
- caveolae form in the absence of clathrin
- invagination/cargo selection regulated by lipid composition of caveolar membrane

### phagocytosis is a special form of endocytosis
- amoebas ingesting paramecia
- neutrophils consuming bacteria

### late endosomes
- early endosomes mature into late endosomes
- more acidic
- different Rab GTPases
- late endosomes are sometimes called multivesicular bodies

### why multivesicular bodies?
- sequesters active membrane proteins from the plasma membrane
- can then be digested in lysosome or released extracellularly

### ESCRT
- store potential energy to bud vesicles
- don't "pull out" vesicles, rather "push in" to form vesicles
- have to be reset like coat proteins to restore potential energy; resetting done by vps4

### autophagy
- self-eating
	- during starvation
	- or for pathogens
	- or for normal cell homeostasis
	- mitophagy

### lysosomes
- intracellular digestion of macromolecules
- 40 types of hydrolytic enzymes
	- proteases
	- nucleases
	- glycosidases
	- phospholipases
- these are all acid hydrolases
	- function at ph 5
	- most acidic organelle
- enzymes are tagged with mannose-6-phosphate; lysosome signal.
